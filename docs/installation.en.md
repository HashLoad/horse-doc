### Boss

The easiest and recommended way to install Horse is with [Boss](https://github.com/HashLoad/boss). With it you can manage the version of the dependencies used in your API, in addition to automatically configuring your project's _ Library Path _.

To perform the installation, simply open the terminal of your choice and enter the following commands:

```bash
$ boss init
$ boss install horse
```

_NOTE: it is worth mentioning that the command `boss init` is to initialize the dependency manager and must be executed only once. If you have already done so, there is no need to do it again._

### Manual

[Download](https://github.com/HashLoad/boss/releases/latest) the latest version of Horse and include the **src/** folder in your project's _Library Path_.
